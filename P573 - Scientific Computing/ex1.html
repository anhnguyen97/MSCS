<h3>
    Clock Resolution and Overhead
</h3>
<p>
Write two functions in C or C++ (or two subroutines in Fortran90+) that will 
get the timings needed to determine a clock's resolution and overhead.
This can based by using the examples of how to call a clock, and they have
makefile examples as well.
Those two functions/subroutines must have the arguments
</p><ul>
    <li> overhead(int* ndatapoints)
    </li><li> resolution(int* ndatapoints)
</li></ul>
Yes, those are both pointers even though the data object is a single int.
For Fortran the arguments are 
<ul>
    <li> overhead(ndatapoints)
    </li><li> resolution(ndatapoints)
    <p>
        integer :: ndatapoints
</p></li></ul>
<p>
Each of those will do the corresponding timer information algorithms shown in
class and in the notes, as found on the 
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/notes/time/6overhead.html">overhead</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/notes/time/3resol.html">resolution</a>
web pages. 
Each of the two functions will open a file, write the timing data to it,
then close the files. The output from the overhead function must be named
data_overhead, and for resolution the name must be
data_resolution. Both files must be in plain ASCII, not binary.

</p><p>
In addition write a main function that
</p><ul>
    <li> Reads in the number of data points (ndatapoints above) from a file
            named 'sizes'
    </li><li> Invokes the two functions overhead and resolution
    </li><li> Finishes
</li></ul>
The main function must not do any I/O other than reading the sizes file.
It can have print statements for debugging, but they must be turned off
or removed when the assignment is turned in.

</p><h3>
    Provided files
</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/show_overheads.m">show_overheads.m</a>, a Matlab script that
    reads in the data file for overheads, and plots the data.
    </li><li> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/show_resolution.m">show_resolution.m</a>, a Matlab script that
    reads in the data file for resolution finding, and plots the data.
    </li><li> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/analyze.m">analyze.m</a>, used by show_resolution.m
    </li><li> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/enlargeaxis.m">enlargeaxis.m</a>, used by show_resolution.m
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><h3>
    Handin
</h3>
<br>
Create a tar file named username-ex1.tar, where username is your email
login name at IU. It must contain
<ul>
    <li> the functions main, overhead, and resolution (with corresponding suffixes)
    </li><li> the corresponding output data files
    </li><li> a short ASCII file with your conclusions: what is overhead and resolution
    for the machine/language/compiler used, and
    how many flops must be in a timing block to assure timings are reliable
    
</li></ul>
Do <b>not</b> include any executable files, object (.o) files, plots generated by
the Matlab scripts and functions, or "hidden" files with names that start with
a period ("."). In general no binary files should be in the tar file.
If you modify the Matlab .m files hand in the ones you changed, but no others.

<p>
Send the tar file as an email attachment to p573@cs.indiana.edu. Notice this
<b>not</b> p573@indiana.edu.

<h3> Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ol>
    <li> How to write a makefile and where is the sample makefile?
    <p> Here is a link where you can find <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/makefiles.html"> makefile
        notes,</a>
    and it has a <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/assignments/asst1/makefile"> sample makefile,</a>
    </p></li><li> How many repetitions/sample data points are needed for finding clock facts?
    <p> Short answer: as many as it takes. The recommended number of samples (aka
    number of data points or ndatapoints) is 200000, but while debugging and testing
    ndatapoints = 1000 is sufficient. The number of operations = noperations is
    in the 
    <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/p573/notes/time/3resol.html">notes about clock resolution </a>.
    Once you know the resolution, 
    the vector length n in finding the overhead should be relatively small. 
    In class, it was suggested n = 2000 but explicitly stated to be something
    determined by experiment. If the clock resolution is high (i.e., 1 microsecond
    or less), n = 78 or 19 may suffice. 
    </p></li><li> When will be assignment 1 due exactly?
    <p> It will be due 11:59 PM 5th Sept, 2012.
