<h1>B552: Knowledge-Based Computation<br>
Spring 2012 <br>
Homework 2: Team Project <br> on Gathering and Representing Everyday Knowledge
</h1>
</center>

This assignment will give you first-hand experience in knowledge
capture for commonsense knowledge, and in the assessment of knowledge
representation schemes.
The assignment will be done by teams of students, in the groups
listed below.  It will be done in three steps:  Group generation of a
knowledge representation, critiques of another group's representations, and
presentations/discussions.  To avoid holding up others, none
of these parts may be submitted late.
<ol>
<li> <b>Due Mon, Feb 20, before class:</b> Each group will select
a restricted domain of everyday knowledge to encode, analogously to
exercise 10.22 in Russell and Norvig (third edition).  The text of
this exercise is at the bottom of this page, and gives extensive
guidance for getting started.  You may use the
Safeway domain or another domain.

<p>The group will select a relatively simple sentence or two about events
in the domain, will select 5-8 questions to answer in that domain, and
will generate the knowledge needed to answer those and similar
questions in a principled (general) way.  The group will write this up
in a 5-10 page report which may include figures for hierarchies, etc.

</p><p> In addition to describing your representation, the writeup should
include information on your design decisions, the major issues that
arose during your work, and any disagreements in the group.  This is
one of the most important components of the assignment.

</p><p> A pdf file of the report should be submitted on Oncourse, and hard
copies should be brought to class to give one to each person in the
group assigned to critique the report.
<b>Please be sure to include your group number and the names
of its group members at the top.</b>


</p><p>

</p></li><li><b>Due Wed, Feb 22, before class:</b>
Each group will prepare
a short critique/commentary on another group's representation.  This
critique should contain your analysis of the strengths of the
approach, as well as constructive criticism of issues you observe and
notes about important differences from your representation.
The group doing the critique is free to ask members of the original
group for clarifications, explanations, etc.  The group doing the
critique should also consider how their own representation would
handle the questions chosen by the group they have critiqued.

The group should submit a pdf file of the critique on Oncourse, and
bring a hard copy of the critique to class for each member of the
group being critiqued.  
<b>Please be sure to include both your group number and the number of
the group being critiqued at the top.</b>

</li><li> <b>In class, Wed, Feb 22:</b> Two-three members of each group
will present  
a 20 minute presentation of the highlights of their representation.
The presentation should
focus on key design decisions, what you found challenging and why,
what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of your representations,
supported by examples, and strengths and weaknesses identified by
considering how to answer the questions chosen by the group you
critiqued.

<p>Two members from the critiquing group (chosen so that all group
members participate in either the main presentation, the critique, or
both) will then do a 5-10 minute presentation with
their comments and questions, to be followed by responses from the
group being critiqued and questions and discussion from the class,
with all group members participating.

</p><p> To make sure your presentation is effective,
 <b>be sure to practice your presentation in advance and have a member
of the group monitor time of the in-class presentation, to warn the
group if timing falls behind plans.</b>

</p><p>All groups should be ready to present on Feb 22, but some
groups will be pushed to the following class, depending on the
amount of discussion on the first day.

</p></li></ol>
 
<p>

The assignment grades will be based on each group's report, 
presentation, and critique.

</p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions!

</p><h1>Student Groups</h1>

<!--
<P>This list is <b>tentative</b>.  It is based on the latest class
roster, but if it misses anyone or includes anyone who's decided not
to continue, please contact me as soon as possible, for me to post the
final list.  Thanks!

<ol>
<li> Alhanoof, Suyog, Sachin, Can, Ashish
</li><li> Tod, Supun, Shweta, Paygude
</li><li> Bitan, Mark, Karthik, Purshottam, Saminda
</li></ol>
Each group will critique the report of the following group (with group
3 critiquing group 1).

<h1>References</h1>

A helpful resource for this assignment is
Russell and Norvig's knowledge representation chapter, especially
Section 8.4.2, which describes steps for knowledge engineering.

<h1>Russell and Norvig's exercise</h1>

(Adapted from an example by Doug Lenat.) Your mission is to
  capture, in logical form, enough knowledge to answer a series of
  questions about the following simple sentence: Yesterday John went
  to the North Berkeley Safeway and bought two pounds of tomatoes and
  a pound of ground beef.  Start by trying to represent its content as
  a series of assertions. You should write sentences that have
  straightforward logical structure (e.g., statements that objects
  have certain properties; that objects are related in certain ways;
  that all objects satisfying one property satisfy another)...

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Which classes, individuals, relations, and so on, would you need? What
are their parents,
siblings and so on? (You will need events and temporal ordering, among
other things.)

</li><li>
Where would they fit in a more general hierarchy?

</li><li>
What are the constraints and interrelationships among them?

</li><li>
How detailed must you be about each of the various concepts?
</li></ul>

The knowledge base you construct must be capable of answering a list
of questions that we will give shortly. Some of the questions deal
with the material stated explicitly in the story, but most of them
require one to know other background knowledge-to read between the
lines. You'll have to deal with what kind of things are at a
supermarket, what is involved with purchasing the things one selects,
what will purchases be used for, and so on. Try to make your
representation as general as possible. To give a trivial example:
don't say "People buy food from Safeway," because that won't help you
with those who shop at another supermarket. Don't say "Joe made
spaghetti with the tomatoes and ground beef," because that won't help
you with anything else at all. Also, don't turn the questions into
answers; for example, question (c) asks "Did John buy any meat?"-not
"Did John buy a pound of ground beef?"

<p>Sketch the chains of reasoning that would answer the questions. In the
process of doing so,
you will no doubt need to create additional concepts, make additional
assertions, and so on. If
possible, use a logical reasoning system to demonstrate the
sufficiency of your knowledge base.
Many of the things you write may only be approximately correct in
reality, but don't worry too
much; the idea is to extract the common sense that lets you answer
these questions at all.
</p><ul>
<li>a. Is John a child or an adult? [Adult]
</li><li>b. Does John now have at least 2 tomatoes? [Yes]
</li><li>c. Did John buy any meat? [Yes]
</li><li>d. If Mary was buying tomatoes at the same time as John, did he see
her? [Yes]
</li><li>e. Are the tomatoes made in the supermarket? [No]
</li><li>f. What is John going to do with the tomatoes? [Eat them]
</li><li>g. Does Safeway sell deodorant? [Yes]
</li><li>h. Did John bring any money to the supermarket? [Yes]
</li><li>i. Does John have less money after going to the supermarket? [Yes]
</li></ul>

Make the necessary additions/changes to your knowledge base from
the previous exercise
so that the following questions can be answered. Show that they can
indeed be answered by
the KB, and include in your report a discussion of the fixes,
explaining why they were needed,
whether they were minor or major, and so on.
<ul>
<li>a. Are there other people in Safeway while John is there? [Yes-staff!]
</li><li>b. Did Mary see John? [Yes]
</li><li>c. Is John a vegetarian? [No]
</li><li>d. Who owns the deodorant in Safeway? [Safeway Corporation]
</li><li>e. Did John have an ounce of ground beef? [Yes]
</li><li>f. Does the Shell station next door have any gas? [Yes]
</li><li>g. Do the tomatoes fit in John's car trunk? [Yes]
</li></ul>

<h1>Optional But Encouraged:  Try It Out!</h1>

Using prolog (accessed with the "pl" command on CS suns, e.g., school) or
a similar system (e.g., a logic programming framework in scheme),
it's easy to encode rules and check their
consequences, which will give a better feeling for how your knowledge
works and whether it has gaps.

<P>If you'd like to explore this, feel free to work together with
others in the class with relevant expertise to help (whether or not in
your group) or to consult with outside students.  Also, there are many
prolog tutorials on the Web, e.g., <A
HREF="http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/prolog/learning.html">Prolog
in Examples</A>.

<P>If you do this, feel free to include some output in your writeup
and class presentation.
