1.	binarytides.com
	http://www.binarytides.com/raw-sockets-c-code-on-linux/
	This was used as a starting point for the project. A function get_local_ip provided here was used to get the local address of the source as getaddrinfo somehow only returned 0.0.0.0.
	
2. 	Beej network guide
	All information on various socket functions and structures.
	
3.	wikipedia.org
